# A channel is in simple terms a container of websocket sessions. When a
# websocket connection is closed it is not removed from the channel
# since that would be a computationly expensive operation. Instead, when
# the sessions are traversed (on every publish) those that are dead a
# removed. However, some channels may have a rather low publish rate and
# that can result in an ever increasing number of dead websocket
# sessions. To prevent that, this configuration option specifies how many
# websocket sessions we can insert in the channel when there is no
# publish activity before we trigger a cleanup.
# 
#   - Doing a cleanup too frequently may have a performance cost since
#     it requires traversal.
