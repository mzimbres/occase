A *post* is the central idea behind the menu-chat. A post carries the
information about an item in a menu entry. A menu is composed of menu
entries. Let us take as an example a menu that has two menu items,
where the first contains the information about location and the second
about car models

   Location (menu1)        | Car (menu2)
                           |

Some important things to notice

   1. The menu1 and menu2 are refered to as menu entries. A deployment
      can use as many menu items as one likes, though there are
      technical difficults as the number of menu items and their sizes
      grow.

   2. The *Location* menu entry has depth 4 whereas the menu *cars*
   has depth 6. We refer however to the menu item depth minus one as
   the root of the three is always one and not used in the app or the
   server.

Codes
-----

It is not difficult to see that we can refer to each of the items in a
menu entry the same way we index chapters, sections, subsections in a
book.  If we omit the root node, we see some of the codes are

   [0, 1, 1] ===> Teresopolis
   [1, 2, 0] ===> Köln
   etc.

A *post* contains the code of the items in each menu entry. So, if the
user want to sell a 

   BMW/320iAi 2.0 TB M Sport ActiveFlex 16V 4p/2018/Gasoline/R$ 165.587,00

in 

   Brazil/Sao Paulo/Atibaia

The post is fully determined by the codes

   [0, 0, 1] and [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
