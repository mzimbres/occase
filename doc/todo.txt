* LOADING Redis is loading the dataset in memory

  This error should be handled in the client and not passed to the occase-db?

* Clear lintian warnings

* Error caught on occase-notify

   occase-notify: ./src/notifier.cpp:269: void
   occase::notifier::on_publish(const string&): Assertion `n == 0' failed.
   Aborted

* Generate passwords without touching redis using device generated
  random numbers.

* Use the notify field in the login command.

* Warning: The following can happen:

  1. User logs in and is not inserted on the sessions hash table but
     the node subscribes to its messages.
  2. A message is sent to the user and the node retrieves it.
  3. Node does not find the user, or finds but session is expired and
     stores it again on redis.
  4. Node is already subscribed to messages to that server and
     retrieves again generating a loop.

  To solve this the node must unsubscribe to that user chat messages
  when it receives it from redis and does not find it on its map.

* Add a new config option to disable sending messages to online users
  directly without storing in redis. This is needed to make sure

  1. Redis keyspace notification is working properly.
  2. Occase-db works properly with multiple nodes.
